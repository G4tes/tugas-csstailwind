# HTML-Tailwind-Boilerplate

My go-to template for any website I'm building with a basic HTML markdown and a default(ish) tailwind config file to get me up and running

# THIS IS NOT PRODUCTION READY!

# First launch

1. `npm install i`
2. open terminal `npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch`
3. open new terminal `live-server`

next time you're loading up. This is required to gather and build everything.
